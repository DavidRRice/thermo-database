PEARL Backend documentation
===========================

PEARL — the Planetary EOS Archive and Reference Library — is an open
catalog of thermodynamic data and equations of state.

This documentation describes the Python backend used to load, validate,
search, manipulate, plot, and export the database contents.

.. note::

   PEARL is under active development. Interfaces and data conventions may
   change before the first stable release.
